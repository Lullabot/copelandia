OAuth implements the OAuth classes for use with Drupal and acts as a support
module for other modules that wish to use OAuth.

OAuth Client flow:

The callback to be used is /oauth/authorized/% where % is the id of the consumer
used by the client. We need the id of the consumer to be able to find the token
correctly.
