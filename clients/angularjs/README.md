# Client written with AngularJS

## Installation

    ~$ cd copelandia/clients/angularjs
    ~$ npm install && bower install --dev
    ~$ gem install susy
    ~$ gem install sass-globbing
    ~$ grunt server

Currently we need the latest _unstable_ version (1.1.4) of Angular JS rather the _stable_ version (1.0.6). This version is called from the google cdn.
