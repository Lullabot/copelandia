# Client written with AngularJS

## Installation

	~$ cd copelandia/clients/angularjs
	~$ npm install && bower install --dev
	~$ grunt server

Currently we need the latest _unstable_ version (1.1.4) of Angular JS rather the _stable_ version (1.0.6). You'll have to download this manually because bower only supports installing the stable version. Replace /clients/angularjs/app/componenets/angular/angular.min.js with > 1.1.4 from angularjs.org
