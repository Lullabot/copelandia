CopelandiOS
===========
***The iOS client for Copelandia!***

This thing sort of works. You can run it if you have XCode installed.

* Click the Run button at top left.
* Wait for the iOS simulator to start.
* When the empty recipe list appears, click the reload button at top left.
* Wait patiently while the app queries a list of recipes, and then the ingredients for each, from lulladev.com.
* Click on recipes to see a little info about them. The recipe display is incomplete.
